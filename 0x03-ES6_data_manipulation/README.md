The '0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation' project focuses on JavaScript programming, specifically utilizing ES6 features such as map, filter, and reduce on arrays, working with typed arrays, and understanding data structures like Set, Map, and WeakMap. The project requires using NodeJS 12.11.x, Jest for testing, and ESLint for linting. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in these concepts by completing tasks that adhere to strict coding standards and passing all tests and lint checks. The project includes creating a README.md file, ensuring all files have a .js extension, and exporting all functions correctly.
